# End-to-End-Big-Data-Engineering-Project-with-Azure
## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a complete Big Data architecture on Azure. It covers data ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization using services such as Azure Data Lake, Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Synapse Analytics. The goal is to build a scalable and optimized data pipeline for analysis and value extraction.

## Project Goals
1. Data Ingestion – Develop a process to collect and import data from various sources.

2. ETL System – Extract raw data, transform it into a structured format, and load it into the target system for analysis.

3. Data Lake – Store data from multiple sources in a centralized repository to ensure scalability and easy access.

4. Cloud Infrastructure – Utilize cloud computing (Azure) to handle large-scale data processing that exceeds local machine capabilities.

5. Reporting & Visualization – Create interactive dashboards to generate insights and answer key business questions.

## Used Services
1. Azure Data Factory: Azure Data Factory is a fully managed data integration service that enables orchestration and automation of data movement and transformation workflows at scale.

2. Azure Data Lake Gen2: A storage service optimized for big data analytics, combining Azure Blob Storage capabilities with data lake-specific features to efficiently manage massive volumes of data.

3. Azure Databricks: A data analytics platform based on Apache Spark that allows processing large-scale data for AI, machine learning, and big data workloads.

4. Azure Synapse Analytics: A cloud-based analytics service that integrates big data and data warehousing, providing powerful SQL-based analytics and Spark-based processing for large-scale data analysis.

5. Power BI: A business intelligence (BI) service that enables data visualization, interactive dashboards, and AI-driven insights to help organizations make data-driven decisions
   
## Dataset Used
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on our website: www.olist.com

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.
